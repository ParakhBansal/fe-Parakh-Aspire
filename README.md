React Debit Card App
Hey there! Welcome to my React Debit Card App. This is a project I built for an assignment, and I’m pretty excited to share it with you. It’s a simple web app where you can manage debit cards, view transactions, and add new cards using a modal. I’ve deployed it on Vercel, and the code is hosted on GitHub. Let’s dive into the details!

What This App Does
This app is designed to mimic a debit card management dashboard. Here’s what you can do with it:

View a list of debit cards in a carousel (using Swiper for smooth sliding).
Toggle between "My debit cards" and "All company cards" (though the latter is just a placeholder for now).
Freeze/unfreeze a card with a button.
Add a new card using a modal popup.
See a list of recent transactions with details like amount, date, and description.
The transactions list is collapsible (accordion-style) so you can toggle between "Card details" and "Recent transactions."

The app is responsive, so it works on both desktop and mobile. On mobile, you’ll see a fixed bottom bar with navigation icons.

Tech Stack
I built this app using the following technologies:

React: For building the UI components.
TypeScript: To add type safety and catch errors early.
Tailwind CSS: For styling the app quickly and making it responsive.
Swiper: For the carousel to display debit cards with pagination dots.
Vite: As the build tool (faster than Create React App).
Vercel: For deployment and automatic updates when I push to GitHub.

How to Run the App Locally
If you want to run this app on your own machine, here’s how you can do it:

Clone the Repository: First, clone the repo from GitHub:git clone https://github.com/ParakhBansal/fe-Parakh-Aspire\cd react-vercel-app

Install Dependencies: I’ve used npm for this project. Install all the dependencies with:npm install

Run the App: Start the development server:npm run dev
This will open the app in your browser (usually at http://localhost:5173  if you’re using Vite).
